This is a tool to quickly save your machine learning models and deploy them on k8s or docker-compose for serving purpose.

<br/>

# Support

- Serve Tensorflow .pb models
- Serve Pytorch models
- Serve MXNet models
- Serve SKLearn models
- Serve other machine learning models saved in .onnx form 


<br/>

# Functions:
### 1:MLModelMgmt: 
Build an image, convert and save your trained models to this serviceable image

**apisï¼š**
- MLModelMgmt.build_image
